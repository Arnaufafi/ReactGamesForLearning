Folder and File Explanation
Here’s a brief explanation of the main files and folders in the project:

src/components/ChangeingHello.tsx
This component displays the greeting text (Hello {text}), where text is passed as a prop. It updates the greeting message dynamically based on user input.

src/components/InputForm.tsx
This component contains a form with an input field and a button. It allows the user to input a new text, and when the button is clicked or the Enter key is pressed, it updates the text value in the parent component (App.tsx).

src/App.tsx
This is the main component that contains the state (name) shared by both ChangeingHello and InputForm. It passes the name to ChangeingHello as a prop and the setName function to InputForm as a callback to update the name.

src/main.tsx
The entry point of the React app, where the root component (App.tsx) is rendered into the root element in index.html.

src/styles
Contains all the CSS files for styling the components:

App.css: Styles for the App.tsx component.
InputForm.css: Styles for the InputForm.tsx component.
.gitignore
A file that specifies which files and directories to ignore when committing to Git (e.g., node_modules/).

package.json
Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.

tsconfig.json
TypeScript configuration file that specifies the compiler options for TypeScript.
